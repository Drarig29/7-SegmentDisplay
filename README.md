# 7-Segment Display
This is a **VB.NET WinForms Control** (.dll).<br>

<br>The library is called **SevenSegmentsDisplay**. It doesn't necessarily make much sense, given that we can use fonts with a "digital style". But I wanted to do this myself, in a way that is not necessarily the best, of course!<br>I accept the recommendations but I won't force myself to make changes...

A demo form is included so you can easily see how it works.<br><br>

It has mainly 6 properties :<br>
* **Digits** - The number of digits.
* **Value** - The value to display.
* **BorderStyle** - The segments border style.
* **HideOffSegments** - Hide or not deactivated segments.
* **SegmentOnColor** - Activated segments' color.
* **SegmentOffColor** - Deactivated segments' color.

It also has [SmartTags](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms171829.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396), which makes it **very intuitive at Design Time**.<br><br>

Good use!<br>
