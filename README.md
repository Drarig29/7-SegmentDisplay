This is a VB.NET WinForms Control (.dll).

The library is called SevenSegmentsDisplay. It doesn't necessarily make much sense, given that we can use fonts with a "digital style". But I wanted to do this myself, in a way that is not necessarily the best, of course!
I accept the recommendations but I won't force myself to make changes...
